Files needed for analysis of engine trees.
Use application from https://github.com/jkormu/Leela-chess-Tree 
Replace engine.py with this one for saving functionality.

weak_engines_move_for_strong_move function in read_tree.py has a lot of potential. No results outputted in graph form as it is not possible (text based) but if combined with NLP could really aid project. Can be used to spot patterns in weaker engines play.
